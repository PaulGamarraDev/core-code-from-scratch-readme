3. Multiply the temperature by 1.8 and add 32 to the result
4. You have your Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion!
5. Go to step # 10
6. Do you want to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius?
7. If the answer is yes go to step # 8 if not go to step # 10
8. Substract 32 from the temperature and multiply the result by 0,5556
9. You have your Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion!

# Some geometry 📐
1. Let's caculate the volume of a 3D shape
2. If the 3D shape is a Cube then
  2.1 Get "a", where "a" is the length of one side of the cube
  2.2 Use the formula: V = a^3
  2.3 Print the result "V"
3. If the 3D shape is a Pyramid then
  3.1 Get "bw", where "bw" is the base width  of the pyramid
  3.2 Get "bl", where "bl" is the base length of the pyramid
  3.3 Get "h", where "h" is the heigth of the pyramid
  3.4 Use the formula: V = 1/3 * (bw * bl * h)
  3.5 Print the result "V"
4. If the 3D shape is a Sphere then
  4.1 Get "r", where "r" is the radius of the sphere
  4.2 Use the formula: V =  4/3 * 3,1416 * r^3
  4.3 Print the result "V"
4. End

# Numbers 📈

1. Get the number "n"
2. Use the formula: N = n mod 2
3. If N = 0 then print: the number is even
4. Else print: the number is odd
5. End
