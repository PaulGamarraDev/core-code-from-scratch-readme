# Average sales and commission

*Description:*

Make a program that asks how many sales the seller had, Once the number of sales is entered, ask for the value of each sale until all are entered,
then return as a result the average value of sales, and the commission that the seller will take, If the seller had more than 5 sales,
his commission will be 15% of the total value of the sales, if he sold 5 or less, his commission will be only 10%.
