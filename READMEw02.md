# Logic problem

*Description:*

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.
  - Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
  - Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
  - Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
  - Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
  - Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

*Analysis:*

  - Alice: if nobody studied she did not study and she will be lying accordingly to the first statment. Alice is lying
  - Eva: if she is telling the truth her comment will be in conflict with the other 3 students. Eva is lying
  - Dan: if he is telling the truth his comment will be in conflict with the other students. Dan is lying
  - Charlie: if he is telling the truth his comment will be in conflict with the other students. Charlie is lying
  - Bob: if he is telling the truth he studied.
