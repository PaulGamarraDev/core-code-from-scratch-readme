# Some geometry 📐
1. Let's caculate the volume of a 3D shape
2. If the 3D shape is a Cube then
  2.1 Get "a", where "a" is the length of one side of the cube
  2.2 Use the formula: V = a^3
  2.3 Print the result "V"
3. If the 3D shape is a Pyramid then
  3.1 Get "bw", where "bw" is the base width  of the pyramid
  3.2 Get "bl", where "bl" is the base length of the pyramid
  3.3 Get "h", where "h" is the heigth of the pyramid
  3.4 Use the formula: V = 1/3 * (bw * bl * h)
  3.5 Print the result "V"
4. If the 3D shape is a Sphere then
  4.1 Get "r", where "r" is the radius of the sphere
  4.2 Use the formula: V =  4/3 * 3,1416 * r^3
  4.3 Print the result "V"
4. End

# Numbers 📈

1. Get the number "n"
2. Use the formula: N = n mod 2
3. If N = 0 then print: the number is even

# How old are you 👴

1. Ask the date of birth
2. Identify the year of the date and save it as variable "birthYear"
3. Identify the current year and save it as variable "actualYear"
4. Use formula: Age = actualYear - birthYear
5. If "actualYear" is greater than "birthYear" then print: You have "Age" years old, where "Age" is the result of the formula at step #4
6. Else print: Invalid year, please check your date if birth
7. End

# Find the treasure 👑
